<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Challenge 14 involves creating a full-stack tech-blog application. Completing this challenge allowed me to demonstrate my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript (including Node, MySql, and the MVC model).</p> 

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Make sure to have GitBash, Node.js, and VSCode installed for sucess. Further installations would be to install NPM MySql, Express, Express Handlebars, handlebars, MySQL2 and Sequelize.</p>

<h2>Useage</h2>
<p>Fist, install all node packages by entering 'npm i' into the command line. Once installations are complete, type 'node server.js' into the command line. There is also a link to the live-site at the bottom of this README.</p>

<h2>Contribution</h2>
<p>Feel free to message me if you have any ideas on how to make this better!</p>

<h2>Test</h2>
<p>No tests were required for this project. That doesn't mean it's a bad idea to include for future, however!</p>
